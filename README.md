# React Blog App

## Description

This is a simple React application that fetches blog posts from the JSONPlaceholder API and displays them. When a user clicks on a specific post, they can view detailed information about the post along with the comments associated with it. 

### Key Features:
- Displays a list of blog posts fetched from JSONPlaceholder.
- Allows users to click on a post to view detailed information.
- Shows the comments associated with each post.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-folder>
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install web-vitals
    npm install axios
    npm install react-router-dom
    npm install boostrap
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Now, you should be able to visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and see the React app running!

## What the App Does

This app fetches blog posts from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) and displays them in a list. When a user clicks on any post title, they are directed to a page showing the full post along with comments associated with that post.

### The two main components are:
- **Post List**: Displays the list of blog posts as clickable links.
- **Post Deata**: Displays the full details of a post and lists its comments.

## Styling

The appâ€™s styling is kept simple and minimal to focus on functionality.
I used Bootrstrap, some CSS, file and inline and font from Google.
